# P5.js simulation: Fourier Series

## Overview
This project is a conversion of a Processing application I originally created in 2021.

Visualizes the Fourier Series by reconstructing user-drawn paths using epicycles.

You can test with no installation via the [link](https://chungplusplus.github.io/p5.js-Fourier-Simulation/).

## Details
- Interactive Drawing: Draw any shape with your mouse, then press Enter to start the calculation.

- Discrete Integration: The algorithm approximates the integral by dividing the path into small discrete intervals and summing them.

- Real-time Controls: Adjust zoom level and the number of roating vectors.
